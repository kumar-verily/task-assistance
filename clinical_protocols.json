Based on your readings, we recommend a doctor's visit for your blood pressure.  One easy way to do this is a video visit with the doctor from our affiliated clinic \\- Onduo. We have availability this week and can get you scheduled. They can help you with lifestyle changes and medication to manage your blood pressure. The American Heart Association recommends treating Stage 2 high blood pressure (140/90 or greater). Please let me know: Would you like to meet with the Onduo doctor by video call? Or are you already working with your primary care doctor on blood pressure in the next 2-4 weeks? (If so, please let me know the date of your next appointment.) Both are good options. We’re here to support you on either path\\! What are your thoughts?* Offer [Telemedicine]() visit with Onduo PC or local PCP |\n",
