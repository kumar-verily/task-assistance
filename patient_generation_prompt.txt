  - Hypoglycemic events (<70 mg/dL, <54 mg/dL)
  - Time in range statistics
  - Patterns (post-meal spikes, overnight lows, etc.)
- Include timestamps, glucose values, and context (before/after meals, exercise, etc.)

### 5. Blood Pressure & Vitals
- Recent BP readings (last 2 weeks, 2-3 times daily)

- Temperature readings if relevant
- Include timestamps and any notable hypertensive or hypotensive events

### 6. Medications
- Current medications with:
  - Medication name (brand and generic)
  - Dosage
  - Frequency
  - Route of administration
  - Start date
  - Prescribing physician
  - Purpose/indication
- Include insulin types and regimens for insulin-dependent patients

- Lipid Panel (last 2 readings):
  - Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, Triglycerides
  - Date and lab name
- Kidney Function:
  - Creatinine, eGFR
- Liver Function:
  - ALT, AST
- Other relevant labs:
  - TSH (thyroid)
  - Vitamin D
  - Microalbumin/Creatinine ratio

### 8. Health Information Exchange (HIE) Data
Simulate data from Zus or similar HIE:
- Recent ER visits (last 6 months)
  - Date, reason, facility, discharge diagnosis
- Hospital admissions (last year)
  - Admission/discharge dates, reason, DRG codes
- Specialist visits:
  - Endocrinologist, Cardiologist, Ophthalmologist, Podiatrist
  - Visit dates, providers, notes summary
- External lab results
- Medication fills from external pharmacies
- Immunization records

### 9. Care Team Messages
Generate realistic message exchanges (last 30 days):
- Patient-initiated messages:
  - Questions about readings
  - Medication questions
  - Symptom reports
  - Request for supplies
  - Technical issues with devices
- Care team responses:
  - Guidance and education
  - Medication adjustments
  - Appointment scheduling
  - Device troubleshooting
- Include timestamps, sender, message content, and context

### 10. Survey Responses
Generate responses to:
- **Diabetes Distress Assessment Scale (DDAS)**:
  - 17 items on 6-point scale
  - Include total score and subscale scores
  - Date completed
- **PROMIS-29**:
  - Physical function
  - Anxiety
  - Depression
  - Fatigue
  - Sleep disturbance
  - Social roles
  - Pain interference
  - Pain intensity
  - Include T-scores
  - Date completed
- **PHQ-9** (depression screening):
  - 9 items, total score
  - Date completed
- **Medication Adherence**:
  - Self-reported adherence scale
  - Barriers to adherence
- **Diabetes Self-Care Activities**:
  - Diet, exercise, blood sugar testing, foot care, medication taking

### 11. Social Determinants of Health
- Employment status
- Insurance coverage
- Food security status
- Transportation access
- Housing stability
- Health literacy level
- Technology access
- Social support system

### 12. Clinical Notes Summary
- Last clinical encounter date
- Provider name
- Assessment and plan summary
- Current goals of care
- Barriers to care

## Variability Requirements

Create diverse patients with varying:
- Control levels (well-controlled, moderately controlled, poorly controlled)
- Complication presence (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, CVD)
- Engagement levels (highly engaged, moderately engaged, disengaged)
- Adherence patterns (excellent, good, poor)
- Socioeconomic backgrounds
- Age ranges and life stages
- Technology proficiency
- Cultural backgrounds

## Realism Requirements

- Use realistic medical values and ranges
- Create coherent clinical pictures (medications should match conditions)
- Generate believable event patterns (hyperglycemia after high-carb meals, etc.)
- Include realistic timestamps and temporal patterns
- Make survey responses consistent with clinical presentation
- Include realistic barriers and challenges patients face

## Output Format

Return data as a JSON array with 20 patient objects. Each patient object should have all the fields above properly structured and nested.

Generate patients with a mix of:
- 8 patients with primarily hyperglycemia issues
- 4 patients with hypoglycemia issues
- 4 patients with hypertension
- 2 patients with hypotension
- 2 patients with mixed issues (e.g., both hyper/hypoglycemia)

Make each patient unique and realistic. Include sufficient clinical detail to support AI-powered clinical decision support.
